media-sort categorizes the provided files and directories (targets) by
moving them into to a structured directory tree, sorting is currently
performed using TVMaze, MovieDB and Google.

by default, tv series are moved to:
  ./<title> S<season>E<episode>.<ext>
and movies are moved to:
  ./<title> (<year>).<ext>

to modify the these paths, you can use the --tv-template and
--movie-template options. These options describe the new file path for
tv series and movies using Go template syntax. You can find the
default values here:
  https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/media-sort/sort#pkg-variables
and you can view all possible template variables here:
  https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/media-sort/sort#Result

The Plex-compatible tv series template is:
  ./<title>/Season <season>/<title> S<season>E<episode>.ext
